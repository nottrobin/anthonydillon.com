		<description>The issue in my case was the svgs are generated at a generic size. For example 500x500. Therefore I needed to used background-size to scale the image. Where as the png is already saved at the correct ratio for best result. Therefore replacing the such with the fallback png solves the issue.

Do you have a specific example of an issue you are trying to solve?</description>

		<description>This trick doesn&#039;t work as you&#039;re not overriding or resetting the background-size property. You&#039;re simply redefining the background-image in a new selector that only Opera will use.</description>
